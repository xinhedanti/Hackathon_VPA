## Requirements

minSdkVersion: 17

## Installation

VoiceItApi2AndroidSDK is available through [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#voiceittech/VoiceItApi2AndroidSDK/).

## API Calls

### Initialization

First import *VoiceItAPI2* and then initialize a reference to the SDK inside an Activity, passing in the API Credentials.

```java
import com.loopj.android.http.JsonHttpResponseHandler;
import cz.msebera.android.httpclient.Header;
import org.json.JSONObject;

import com.voiceit.voiceit2.VoiceItAPI2;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private VoiceItAPI2 myVoiceIt;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        myVoiceIt = new VoiceItAPI2("API_KEY","API_TOK");
    }
}
```

### Liveness Detection

For our Encapsulated Face and Video Verification methods, liveness detection can be enabled with a passed in boolean parameter and number of checks to make(2 Recommended). This enables a a pre-check before the verification api call to make sure the user is not trying to spoof with a photo of someone else.

### API calls

For each API call, a JsonHttpResponseHandler is needed to receive the result of the call. You can override the response handlers like so, and abbreviated with ellipses below:
```java
new JsonHttpResponseHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(int statusCode, Header[] headers, JSONObject response) {
        System.out.println("JSONResult : " + response.toString());
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(int statusCode, Header[] headers, Throwable throwable, JSONObject errorResponse) {
        if (errorResponse != null) {
            System.out.println("JSONResult : " + errorResponse.toString());
        }
    }
});
```

Note: Immediately upon calling this method it displays an enrollment view controller to the user that completely takes care of the three enrollments, including the UI and then provides relevant callbacks for whether the user cancelled their enrollments or successfully completed them. Also note, if less than the required enrollments exist for the user, it deletes them and reenrolls.

```java
